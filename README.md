What did I do particularly well?
I clearly defined the software architecture, including the use of object-oriented principles, ensuring that the system would be scalable and easy to maintain. My diagrams and explanations were organized and easy to understand.

What about working through a design document helped me?
Creating the design document forced me to fully think through the architecture and major components before coding. It made the development process more efficient and helped anticipate potential issues early.

What would I revise if I could?
I would improve the section on exception handling by going into more detail about potential edge cases and how the system would recover from errors. In future documents, I would include more comprehensive risk assessments.

How did I interpret the user's needs? Why is it important?
I carefully read the client's description and prioritized cross-platform compatibility and multiplayer functionality. It's crucial to consider user needs because successful software must meet client goals and provide a seamless user experience.

How did I approach designing software? What would I use next time?
I started by identifying core components (such as the Game class and Player management) and then mapped their interactions. In the future, I would continue using flowcharts and UML diagrams early on to help visualize the system before writing any code.
